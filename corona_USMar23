    "description": "Watch Harry Styles play \"Cherry\", \"Watermelon Sugar\", \"To Be So Lonely\" and \"Adore You\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nDid you know you can watch new Tiny Desk concerts on npr.org ONE WEEK before they go up on YouTube? Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\n\nFollow NPR Music:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nMarch 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. \"It just feels like you're in the way,\" he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.\n\nBacked by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to \"Watermelon Sugar,\" to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in \"Adore You.\" The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.\n\nStyles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.\n\nBut beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance – and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.\n\n\"I have to come into NPR more often,\" Styles said after he and his band played their first song. \"It's nice here.\"\n\nWe — and our massive crowd of colleagues — couldn't agree more.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cherry\"\n\"Watermelon Sugar\"\n\"To Be So Lonely\"\n\"Adore You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR",

     "description": "Watch Harry Styles play \"Cherry\", \"Watermelon Sugar\", \"To Be So Lonely\" and \"Adore You\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nDid you know you can watch new Tiny Desk concerts on npr.org ONE WEEK before they go up on YouTube? Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\n\nFollow NPR Music:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nMarch 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. \"It just feels like you're in the way,\" he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.\n\nBacked by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to \"Watermelon Sugar,\" to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in \"Adore You.\" The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.\n\nStyles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.\n\nBut beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance – and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.\n\n\"I have to come into NPR more often,\" Styles said after he and his band played their first song. \"It's nice here.\"\n\nWe — and our massive crowd of colleagues — couldn't agree more.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cherry\"\n\"Watermelon Sugar\"\n\"To Be So Lonely\"\n\"Adore You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR"

    "description": "Cook #withme #stayhome - Join Molly Baz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she makes roast chicken and potatoes. This isn’t the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you’re probably familiar with. Instead, it’s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that’s more similar to rotisserie chicken—except (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat. Makes you wonder why you haven't always been roasting long-cooking vegetables—carrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash, fennel—under the bird for a built-in side, huh?\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/slow-roast-gochujang-chicken\r\nFilmed on November 4, 2019.\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?

    "description": "JaVale McGee and Shaquille O’Neal are two NBA big men of different styles, shapes, and generations. You might not think they’d have beef as they rarely saw each other on the court, but as Shaq moved into his role as analyst with a big personality, their adversarial relationship developed. \n\nThey have a sort of a big brother-little brother relationship. Not in the sense that Shaq looked out for JaVale or anything like that, no certainly not. More in the sense of... Shaq teased JaVale until it became a real fight so vicious Mom had to step in. Seriously their moms got involved.\n\nWhat spurred this beef?  2.75 words: Shaqtin A Fool\n\nJaVale McGee was featured on the blooper segment more than any other player, ever. And guess what? He didn’t like that. This is a classic tale of a joke gone too far.

    "description": "Hey Guys! Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of shoes. They are some cheap knock offs of Vans, but still. They came out really cute.

    "description": "Jimmy continues his daily mini monologues at his house during the quarantine. In today’s #Minilogue Jimmy celebrates #FormalFriday by dressing up as if he is going somewhere – even though we’re all stuck at home. If you dressed up today and want to share your experience, post photos and videos with #FormalFriday and Jimmy will show some of his favorites next week. Jimmy also talks about online comments regarding his appearance, Trump lashing out at NBC’s Peter Alexander, Sean Spicer showing up at the press briefing, some Senators selling off massive amounts of stock shortly after a Coronavirus briefing, the toilet paper crisis, and most of Las Vegas shutting down. During times like these, it’s also good to check in on old friends, so Jimmy talks to Brandon Flowers and Ronnie Vannucci of The Killers via webchat, and they perform “Caution\" from their new album “Imploding The Mirage.\" Jimmy will be making a donation to a worthwhile cause every day during this quarantine.

    "description": "Everything YOU need to know about today's official PS5 spec release. As many of you know, Playstation launched it's full specs for their new console, you can see them all, right here. \n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW to The Gamer! Click here: https://goo.gl/9cpWgf \n\nThe PlayStation 5 will come with a 825 GB Solid State Drive, a GPU capable of producing 10.3 teraflops and a custom made Tempest 3D AudioTech engine, among many more incredible specs! We’re just happy to hear something from Sony after all those months of complete silence, so let’s get into each of these confirmed features in more detail.\n\nThe SSD is not only going to give players instant load times, it’s also going to cut down on install times for patches, which is one of the most persistent problems with PS4 games. The PS5 will also come with an expansion bay for expanded SSD storage, which is just an awesome addition to a console that already looks great on paper. The PS5 will feature a custom eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU, clocked at 3.5GHz, and a custom GPU based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture capable of producing 10.28 teraflops, clocked at 2.23GHz, as well as 16GB of GDDR6 RAM. This all means incredible graphics and ray tracing capabilities. Count us in! Lastly, Sony is focusing on 3D audio with their Tempest 3D AudioTech engine that will improve locality and immersion. While we didn’t get to see the console’s design, all this info is a step in the right direction.\n\nWe’ll dive deeper into the specs and features of the PS5 than just that so enjoy the video, let us know what you think about the next gen console in the comments section below and don’t forget to subscribe to TheGamer for more gaming videos.\n\nFor copyright matters, please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/thegamerwebsite\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thegamercom/\n \nOur Website\nhttp://thegamer.com",

    "description": "English transcript: http://blog.jetblue.com/englishtranscript/\nSpanish transcript: http://blog.jetblue.com/spanishtranscript/\nLearn more about how JetBlue is responding to coronavirus: http://blog.jetblue.com/coronavirus/\n\nWe are sharing this personal message from JetBlue’s President and Chief Operating Officer, Joanna Geraghty. In this video, she talks about how JetBlue is caring for our customers and crewmembers in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. She also shares some schedule changes and our enhanced coronavirus safety precautions.\n\nKeeping you and our crewmembers safe.\nSafety is our first priority at JetBlue, and we have worked diligently with the experts to make sure we are doing our part to slow the spread of coronavirus. For enhanced protection, you will see our crewmembers wearing medical-grade gloves for your safety and theirs.

Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. Falcon 9’s fairing previously supported the first launch of Starlink in May 2019. Approximately 45 minutes after liftoff, SpaceX’s fairing recovery vessels, “Ms. Tree” and “Ms. Chief,” will attempt to recover the two fairing halves.",

    "description": "After years of neglect and shed storage, we're attempting to get this old VW Buggy working again so it can go head to head in a race with Martys JDM MR2. With just $10,000 each to buy and fix a car, we have to get our nuggets working and ready for battle! \n\nBut seems old VW's can be temperamental and need some extra love. After a complete carburettor rebuild and a complete new fuel system, we're trying to start this car for the first time in half a decade. But some of the parts we need to research have had questionable Google results... (make sure your Safe Search is on)\n\n►MCM HATS HERE: https://mightycarmods.com/collections/clothing/products/mighty-car-mods-flexfit-hat\n\nMORE MERCH HERE ►http://www.mightycarmods.com/collections/\n\nBe sure to check out the MCM Facebook Page for regular Updates\n\n►http://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods\n\n✌️ JDM Air Fresheners https://mightycarmods.com/collections/accessories/products/mcm-car-air-freshener\n👕 BRAND NEW Engine Heart T-shirt https://mightycarmods.com/collections/clothing/products/engine-heart-t-shirt\n🔔 Hit the bell next to Subscribe so you don't miss a video!\n\nAlso something to note around Mighty Car Mods: we are normal guys and are not trained mechanics.

     "description": "After years of neglect and shed storage, we're attempting to get this old VW Buggy working again so it can go head to head in a race with Martys JDM MR2. With just $10,000 each to buy and fix a car, we have to get our nuggets working and ready for battle! \n\nBut seems old VW's can be temperamental and need some extra love. After a complete carburettor rebuild and a complete new fuel system, we're trying to start this car for the first time in half a decade. But some of the parts we need to research have had questionable Google results... (make sure your Safe Search is on)\n\n►MCM HATS HERE: https://mightycarmods.com/collections/clothing/products/mighty-car-mods-flexfit-hat\n\nMORE MERCH HERE ►http://www.mightycarmods.com/collections/\n\nBe sure to check out the MCM Facebook Page for regular Updates\n\n►http://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods\n\n✌️ JDM Air Fresheners https://mightycarmods.com/collections/accessories/products/mcm-car-air-freshener\n👕 BRAND NEW Engine Heart T-shirt https://mightycarmods.com/collections/clothing/products/engine-heart-t-shirt\n🔔 Hit the bell next to Subscribe so you don't miss a video!\n\nAlso something to note around Mighty Car Mods: we are normal guys and are not trained mechanics.

    "title": "The PERFECT Home Workout (Sets and Reps Included)",
    "description": "Home workouts can be a lifesaver, especially in times when you cannot get to the gym. In this video, I’m going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time.\n\nThis perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer.\n\nThis workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour.\n\nWith this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere.\n\nThese patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown.\n\nKeep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it.\n\nHere is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A:\n\n1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nAlt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners)\n1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure)\nJump Squats\n\n2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nHandstand Pushups OR Power Pushaways\nRotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational Pushups\nCobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups\n\n3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nAlt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use “kickstand” if needed)\nAlt. Sprinter Lunges \nPlyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)\n\n4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nPullups OR Seated Pullups\nHuman Pullovers OR BW Sliding Pulldowns\nInverted Chin Curls\n\n5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nReverse Corkscrews\nBlack Widow Knee Slides\nLevitation Crunches\n\n6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nAngels and Devils\n\nCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)\n\nHere is how to construct the perfect home workout B:\n\nHINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS\nSlick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)\nLong Leg March\nHigh Hip Bucks\n\nLUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS\nAlt. Crossover Step Ups\nAlt. Reverse Lunges\nSplit Squat Jumps\n\nUPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDS\nVariable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat Pushups\nAlt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners)\nTricep BW Extensions (long head stretch)\n\nUPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDS\nChin Ups OR Seated Chin Ups\nInverted Rows\nBack Widows\n\nABS x 2 ROUNDS\nAb Halos\nV-Up Tucks\nSit-Up Elbow Thrusts\n\nCORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDS\nReverse Hypers\n\nCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)\n\nIf you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.\n\nFor a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program.

    "description": "The World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Monday that while he is pleased to see increased social distancing globally, the best way to stop COVID-19 from spreading is to \"test and isolate.\" He said countries must increase testing and isolate those who test positive, as well as close contacts, stressing their key message is \"test, test, test.\"\n\nGhebreyesus added that as some countries have exceeded their capacities to care for patients with mild symptoms and they should focus on more severe cases and prioritize those with underlying conditions. He said mild cases could be isolated at home and gave directions on safety procedures on how to take care of patients at home, including sleeping in a different bedroom, using a different bathroom, and wearing protective masks.\n\nThe director-general called COVID-19 the \"defining global health crisis of our time,\" and that fighting it would be a test of trust in science and in solidarity. He said moments like people applauding health workers in places like Italy shows the type of human solidarity that should become more \"infectious\" than the disease.\n\n***Please note that this press conference is virtual. ***\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6683518/who-testing-coronavirus-march-16/\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #COVID19 #Coronavirus",

     "description": "The World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Monday that while he is pleased to see increased social distancing globally, the best way to stop COVID-19 from spreading is to \"test and isolate.\" He said countries must increase testing and isolate those who test positive, as well as close contacts, stressing their key message is \"test, test, test.\"\n\nGhebreyesus added that as some countries have exceeded their capacities to care for patients with mild symptoms and they should focus on more severe cases and prioritize those with underlying conditions. He said mild cases could be isolated at home and gave directions on safety procedures on how to take care of patients at home, including sleeping in a different bedroom, using a different bathroom, and wearing protective masks.\n\nThe director-general called COVID-19 the \"defining global health crisis of our time,\" and that fighting it would be a test of trust in science and in solidarity. He said moments like people applauding health workers in places like Italy shows the type of human solidarity that should become more \"infectious\" than the disease.\n\n***Please note that this press conference is virtual. ***\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6683518/who-testing-coronavirus-march-16/\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #COVID19 #Coronavirus"
