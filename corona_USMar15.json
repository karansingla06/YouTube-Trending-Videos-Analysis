    "description": "If we can slow the virus down, it could save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nRead more about the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic at http://vox.com/coronavirus\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as a pandemic. That means the disease no longer constitutes just an outbreak or even an epidemic; the coronavirus has now spread around the world, and will continue to reach into other countries and communities.\n\nThat’s in part because of how contagious the virus is. When you’re infected with the flu, it takes about two days before you start to show symptoms. But coronavirus symptoms take an average of five to six days to appear, so it’s easy to spread well before you notice that you’re feeling sick. Many people are spreading it while going about their daily lives as usual.\n\nThe risk is that once coronavirus starts to spread in a community, about 20% of cases are severe and may require hospitalization. As those cases multiply, hospitals can fill up quickly. And people with severe cases of COVID-19 who can’t receive proper medical attention are at a much higher risk of dying.\n\nIdeally, we would be able to stop the virus from spreading entirely. We can’t do that right now. What we can do is slow it down, so that the severe cases get spread out over a longer period of time, and hospitals are less likely to be overwhelmed on any given day. And that’s where each one of us comes in. The best way to slow down the spread is for everyone — healthy, sick, young, old — to limit social contact as much as possible, immediately. This is called social distancing, and it only works if enough of us do it. But if we do, it could mean the difference between the life and death of someone you know.\n\nRead more on Vox: \n\nHow social distancing and “flattening the curve” works:  http://bit.ly/3aOlHM8\nThe math behind social distancing: http://bit.ly/3a78wG8\nThe rules of social distancing: http://bit.ly/2xDoZnb\n\nHow does the coronavirus outbreak end?

    "title": "The PERFECT Home Workout (Sets and Reps Included)",
    "description": "Home workouts can be a lifesaver, especially in times when you cannot get to the gym. In this video, I’m going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time.\n\nThis perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer.\n\nThis workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour.\n\nWith this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere.\n\nThese patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown.\n\nKeep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it.\n\nHere is how to construct the perfect home total body workout A:\n\n1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nAlt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners)\n1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure)\nJump Squats\n\n2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nHandstand Pushups OR Power Pushaways\nRotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational Pushups\nCobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups\n\n3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nAlt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use “kickstand” if needed)\nAlt. Sprinter Lunges \nPlyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)\n\n4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nPullups OR Seated Pullups\nHuman Pullovers OR BW Sliding Pulldowns\nInverted Chin Curls\n\n5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nReverse Corkscrews\nBlack Widow Knee Slides\nLevitation Crunches\n\n6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED)\nAngels and Devils\n\nCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)\n\nHere is how to construct the perfect home workout B:\n\nHINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS\nSlick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)\nLong Leg March\nHigh Hip Bucks\n\nLUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS\nAlt. Crossover Step Ups\nAlt. Reverse Lunges\nSplit Squat Jumps\n\nUPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDS\nVariable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat Pushups\nAlt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners)\nTricep BW Extensions (long head stretch)\n\nUPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDS\nChin Ups OR Seated Chin Ups\nInverted Rows\nBack Widows\n\nABS x 2 ROUNDS\nAb Halos\nV-Up Tucks\nSit-Up Elbow Thrusts\n\nCORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDS\nReverse Hypers\n\nCOMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES)\n\nIf you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week.\n\nFor a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program. No equipment at all is required. Build muscle at home in just 6 short weeks.\n\nFor more home workout videos and the best exercises to build muscle at home, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and don’t forget to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.\n\nBuild Muscle in 90 Days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24",

    "description": "Germany joins a growing list of EU countries to at least partially shut out its neighbors. Authorities here have decided to close borders with Switzerland and Austria. That's according to German media reports. Added restrictions are also being imposed on the French-German boundary. Spain is in lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus Covid-19. Unprecedented lockdowns and border closures are coming into effect in many European countries, and the streets are empty throughout Europe, with Spain and France among the worst hit by the virus' spread behind Italy. \nEngland is planning self-isolation measures for all people over 70, for up to four months. Austria's Chancellor Sebstian Kurz says his government is banning gatherings of more than five people. Iran's coronavirus death toll has leapt by 113 in one day to reach 724. And the Vatican says all Easter services will take place without worshipers in attendance. Pope Francis will hold Sunday blessings via TV and the internet. Meanwhile, the United States has tightened its ban on visitors from Europe. President Donald Trump says it will now include travelers from Britain and Ireland. In countries that are far away from coronavirus hotspots, like Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, the response from authorities has ranged from tough to nonexistent.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\r\nFollow DW on social media:\r\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\r\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\r\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/\r\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle\n#Coronavirus #Covid19 #dwNews",

     "description": "President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force team give updates on the disease in a White House briefing. #FoxNews\n\nFOX News operates the FOX News Channel (FNC), FOX Business Network (FBN), FOX News Radio, FOX News Headlines 24/7, FOXNews.com and the direct-to-consumer streaming service, FOX Nation. FOX News also produces FOX News Sunday on FOX Broadcasting Company and FOX News Edge. A top five-cable network, FNC has been the most-watched news channel in the country for 17 consecutive years. According to a 2018 Research Intelligencer study by Brand Keys, FOX News ranks as the second most trusted television brand in the country. Additionally, a Suffolk University/USA Today survey states Fox News is the most trusted source for television news or commentary in the country, while a 2017 Gallup/Knight Foundation survey found that among Americans who could name an objective news source, FOX News is the top-cited outlet. FNC is available in nearly 90 million homes and dominates the cable news landscape while routinely notching the top ten programs in the genre.\n \nSubscribe to Fox News!  https://bit.ly/2vBUvAS\nWatch more Fox News Video: http://video.foxnews.com\nWatch Fox News Channel Live: http://www.foxnewsgo.com/\n\nWatch full episodes of your favorite shows\nThe Five: http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-the-five/\nSpecial Report with Bret Baier: http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-special-report/\nThe Story with Martha MacCallum: http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-the-story-with-martha-maccallum/\nTucker Carlson Tonight: http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/\nHannity:  http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-hannity/\nThe Ingraham Angle: http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-the-ingraham-angle/\nFox News @ Night: http://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-fox-news-night/\n \nFollow Fox News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FoxNews/\nFollow Fox News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/FoxNews/\nFollow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/"

With his forthcoming album, \nA Beautiful Disaster, Jelly Roll draws you in with his ability to tell a story that you \ndidn't even know you were a part of. With songs like \"Creature\", \"I Need You\", \n\"Nothing Left At All\" and the dark, haunting love story \"Suicide\" along with features \nfrom the likes of Tech N9ne, Struggle Jennings, Krizz Kaliko and Lil Wyte, \nA Beautiful Disaster gives you a direct link to the life of Jelly Roll - the trials and tribulations, \nalong with the celebrations and victories.",

    "description": "#이태원클라쓰OST #BTS_V #SweetNight\n\n첫 방송 이후 매회 자체 최고 시청률을 새로 쓰며 멈추지 않는 ‘직진본능’을 계속하고 있는 JTBC 드라마 [이태원 클라쓰]의 열두 번째 OST가 공개됐다.\n \n방탄소년단 뷔가 직접 프로듀싱하고 가창에 참여한 이태원 클라쓰 OST Part. 12 [Sweet Night]는 어쿠스틱 사운드를 기반으로 한 인디 팝(INDIE POP) 곡이다. 어쿠스틱 기타로 곡을 이끌어가며 후반부에 나오는 뷔의 허밍과 바이올린의 조화로운 사운드가 돋보인다. 쓰리고 아픈 수많은 밤을 만난 박새로이에게 ‘Sweet Night’라는 곡 제목처럼 달달한 밤만 선사해주고 싶은 마음을 담은 위로의 트랙이다.\n\n뷔는 그동안 RM과 함께한 '네시'를 비롯해 '풍경', ‘Winter bear’ 등 작업 곡들을 꾸준히 발표하며 음악적 역량을 발휘해왔다.\n\n작업 후기 from V (BTS)\n이태원 클라쓰는 옛날 웹툰으로 먼저 봤었는데, 나름의 교훈도 얻어가며 재미있게 보았던 기억이 난다. 특히 박새로이라는 캐릭터가 인상 깊었고, 너무 좋았는데 내가 좋아하는 친구같은 형이 박새로이 역을 맡아 너무 기쁘다. 이런 멋진 드라마에 자작곡으로 참여할 수 있게 되어 감사하다. 많이 사랑해 주셨으면 좋겠다.\n\n[Credits]\nMusic Director 박성일\n\nProduced by Hiss noise, V\n(Hiss noise, V, ADORA, Melanie Joy Fontana, Michel “Lindgren” Schulz)\n\nKeyboard Hiss noise\nSynthesizer Hiss noise\nBass nobody\nGuitar YOUNG\nChorus Matilda Mann\nString Arrangement Hiss noise\nStrings 햄스트링\nVocal Arrangement Pdogg\nDigital Editing Hiss noise\nRecording Engineers Pdogg @ Dogg Bounce, Hiss noise @ Analog lab, 정우영 @ Big Hit Studio, Arcades @ The Arcade\nMix Engineer Yang Ga @ Big Hit Studio\nMastering Engineer Randy Merrill @ Sterling Sound, New York, USA\n\nMarketing Planning 이민지, 김민정\nMusic Video Edited by 김현정, 박진영\nDistributor 이민지, 박경민\n\nAlbum Producer 구교철\nExecutive Producer ㈜블렌딩\n\n\n[#] Vlending은 MV, 드라마OST를 유통 하는 공식 채널입니다.\n[#] Vlending is an official channel distributing MV, drama series soundtracks.\n\n📍  VLENDING OFFICIAL CHANNEL\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vlending\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/vlending\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/vlending/",

    "description": "Everybody has a soul. Joe Gardner is about to find his. Watch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s Soul, in theaters June 19. \n\nAbout Soul: \nJoe Gardner is a middle-school band teacher who gets the chance of a lifetime to play at the best jazz club in town. But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before – a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22, who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions.\n \nFeaturing the voices of Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Phylicia Rashad, Angela Bassett, Ahmir Questlove Thompson, Daveed Diggs, “Soul” is directed by Academy Award® winner Pete Docter (“Inside Out,” “Up”), co-directed by Kemp Powers (“One Night in Miami”) and produced by Academy Award nominee Dana Murray (Pixar short “Lou”). Globally renowned musician Jon Batiste will be writing original jazz music for the film, and Oscar®-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (“The Social Network”), from Nine Inch Nails, will compose an original score that will drift between the real and soul worlds. \n \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/pixarsoul/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/pixarsoul\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/pixarsoul/\nHashtag: #PixarSoul",

The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfood\n\nBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it’s also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it’s still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you’ll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world. Tabriz is known around the world for its exquisite carpet making.\n\nTabriz Central Mosque - Bazaar of Tabriz - In addition to the amazing Iranian food, we also visited the Tabriz Central Mosque.\n\nHaj Ali Kebab - One of the most famous and best restaurants in Tabriz is Haj Ali Kebab, where you’ll find some of the best kebabs in Tabriz. The kebabs were so incredibly juicy, especially with Persian style butter rice, and some roasted tomatoes and sumac. It was a wonderful lunch within the ancient bazaar.\n\nShazdeh Restaurant - Along with plenty of street food snacks, our final Iranian food meal at the bazaar was at Shazdeh Restaurant, and one dish you can’t miss are the kufta Tabrizi, one of the ultimate dishes of Tabriz.\n\nIt was an amazing day, and a throwback in time, learning about and discovering the ancient bazaar of Tabriz, Iran!\n\nThank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.\n\nFriends in the video:\nMr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/\nPersia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourguide/\nRambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rastegar/\nAli: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\nhttps://www.audionetwork.com/\n\n——————————————————\n\n🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!\nhttps://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens\n\n👕Get t-shirts and caps:\nhttps://migrationology.com/store/\n\n📷Camera gear I use:\nhttps://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",
