    "title": "8 Worst Bodyweight Exercises Ever (STOP DOING THESE!)",
    "description": "The worst bodyweight exercises are often times the most common calisthenic exercises. In this video, I’m going to show you 8 bodyweight exercises you’ll want to stop doing, and more importantly, the exercise substitutions you should make to keep the gains coming and prevent injury from doing the wrong things.\n\nWe start with the popular bench dip. The reason people do this exercise for their triceps is to get a complete contraction on the muscle by getting the arm behind the body which allows for better activation of the triceps long head. The issue here is the position of the shoulder that many assume just to get in position to perform it. The head of the humerus is thrown anteriorly, which stretches and weakens the anterior shoulder capsule (an area already chronically weak and unstable on many). You can either vary the hand position as shown or switch to the cobra pushup as a way to get the same tricep benefits without the shoulder joint compromise.\n\nNext we have the popular plank. Now, while this is a core exercise performed by many it doesn’t mean that it’s a good one. Besides the fact that it is entirely remedial for almost everyone that does it (not providing nearly enough of a core challenge to adequately stimulate or strengthen your core muscles) it also tends to reinforce some postural imbalances that are already all too common, with the posterior chain muscles getting too little stimulation in favor of the anterior chain. See the plank alternatives in the video linked at the end of this video.\n\nThe hurdler’s hamstring stretch is not at all the best way to stretch your hamstrings. Many will perform it but not understand why it’s so ineffective for creating actual length increases of the hamstring muscles. The issue is the amount of posterior pelvic tilt that occurs when you perform it. When this happens the hamstrings are put on slack and the stretch is greatly minimized. Instead, either do so out of a taller posture where the pelvis is rotated anteriorly or try the standing hamstring wall stretch for a much better effect.\n\nNeck bridges are just not something you want to do to your neck. Yes, they are incredibly effective for creating overload and developing larger neck muscles, but at what expense. You only get one set of cervical vertebra in your lifetime. Protect them. Avoid the compression and shearing stresses piled on your discs with this exercise in favor of the flexion and extension isometrics shown.\n\nKipping pullups are not pullups. No further discussion needed!\n\nScorpions are performed to increase spinal mobility and movement. The problem is, increased lumbar rotation is not something you should be aspiring to create. The lumber spine is designed to be stable. Mobility in the area should come from the hips not the low back. Instead, opt for the t-spine mobility drill shown here to attack the area most capable of giving you the rotation that you seek.\n\nSissy squats are another bad bodyweight exercise you should avoid. It’s not so much the knees over toes that is the issue but that it is combined with the extra stretch on the quads from above that creates a tremendous amount of stress on the quadriceps and patellar tendons. Opt for a single leg modified pistol squat instead.\n\nFinally, while popular, the pushup is one of the most often misperformed bodyweight exercises around. Be sure not to cut the range of motion even a few inches here if you want to see the real benefits of the exercise.\n\nFor a complete workout program where all of the exercises are selected based on science, be sure to head to athleanx.com at the link below to see how to train like an athlete and look like one in just a few months of proper training. Our Xero program is 100 percent bodyweight and requires no equipment at all.\n\nFor more bodyweight exercise videos and the worst exercises you should avoid, be sure to subscribe to our channel at the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.\n\nBuild Muscle in 90 Days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW",

    "description": "😃Follow Mr. Taster: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMrtaster/\n🎥Street Food in Rasht, Iran: https://youtu.be/XhkQelZX2c8\n👕T-shirts and caps: https://migrationology.com/store/\n\nTABRIZ, IRAN - One of my favorite cities we visited during our trip to Iran, was Tabriz, located in Northern Iran. The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfood\n\nBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it’s also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it’s still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you’ll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world.

The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfood\n\nBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it’s also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it’s still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you’ll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world. Tabriz is known around the world for its exquisite carpet making.\n\nTabriz Central Mosque - Bazaar of Tabriz - In addition to the amazing Iranian food, we also visited the Tabriz Central Mosque.\n\nHaj Ali Kebab - One of the most famous and best restaurants in Tabriz is Haj Ali Kebab, where you’ll find some of the best kebabs in Tabriz.

    "description": "And why COVID-19 was bound to happen. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and don't forget to turn on notifications: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAs of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.\n\nBoth SARS and COVID-19 are in the \"coronavirus\" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge. \n\nFollow our reporting on coronavirus on vox.com: \nOur updated guide to Covid-19: http://bit.ly/3cGvqpU\n11 questions about the coronavirus outbreak, answered: http://bit.ly/3cHFSgT\nWhy washing your hands is so important: http://bit.ly/39vOaGy\n\nWatch our Netflix episode \"The next pandemic, explained\" https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062202\n\nFurther reading:\nPeter Li: https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3047828/first-sars-now-wuhan-coronavirus-heres-why-china-should-ban-its\nPeter Daszak, EcoAlliance: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html\nWildAid: https://wildaid.org/chinese-citizens-call-for-permanent-ban-on-wildlife-markets/\nOn the animal source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w?fbclid=IwAR1TaU8leMGzeMUzV0uZVIOBskJC2Zh4P7hixJfBEvwnsouHZGZnF4QTz_A\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

     "description": "And why COVID-19 was bound to happen. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and don't forget to turn on notifications: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAs of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.\n\nBoth SARS and COVID-19 are in the \"coronavirus\" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge. \n\nFollow our reporting on coronavirus on vox.com: \nOur updated guide to Covid-19: http://bit.ly/3cGvqpU\n11 questions about the coronavirus outbreak, answered: http://bit.ly/3cHFSgT\nWhy washing your hands is so important: http://bit.ly/39vOaGy\n\nWatch our Netflix episode \"The next pandemic, explained\" https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062202\n\nFurther reading:\nPeter Li: https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3047828/first-sars-now-wuhan-coronavirus-heres-why-china-should-ban-its\nPeter Daszak, EcoAlliance: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/science/bats-coronavirus-Wuhan.html\nWildAid: https://wildaid.org/chinese-citizens-call-for-permanent-ban-on-wildlife-markets/\nOn the animal source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w?fbclid=IwAR1TaU8leMGzeMUzV0uZVIOBskJC2Zh4P7hixJfBEvwnsouHZGZnF4QTz_A\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUM\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.com\nHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'\n\nI learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.\n\nIn the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.\n\nSchrodinger's cat animation by Iván Tello\nWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny Hyman\nFilming of opening sequence by Casey Rentz\n\nSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the script\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

    "description": "Doja Cat - Streets - Live Performance (Vevo LIFT Live Sessions) \n\nWelcome to the world of Doja Cat. Born and raised in L.A., the 24-year-old self-taught singer-rapper behind “Candy” is a vet of sorts. The arts were central to her upbringing, and she started sharing her music on Soundcloud back in 2013. A year later she dropped her much-buzzed-about ‘Purrr!’ EP, and since she’s nurtured an ever-growing array of feverish fans who revere her for combining a radiant charisma with a unique flow and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (see: the irresistible“MOOO!”). Seems like Doja has designed her version of alt-R&B to take off in any direction she chooses. Tours with Lizzo and Theophilius London led right into 2018’s impressive ‘Amala’ debut, followed by last year’s ‘Hot Pink.’ That album’s “Say So” is currently clocking big numbers. Arresting visuals help. Her videos for “Rules,” and “Say So” are wildly fun. Ditto for the hyper footage from ‘Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey’ that makes a nice parallel to Doja’s “Boss Bitch” track. When the Vevo production team united with the feline phenom to figure out performance ideas, the creative juices were flowing. The goal? Put the “cat” in Doja Cat - a decision that resulted in what’s probably our most ambitious studio build to date for a LIFT performance. For “Streets,” we built a massive bowl of milk. Doja hopped in that 2% and bodied the beat - clearly in her element. Time to wet your whiskers, and if this one’s not wild enough for ya, stay tuned: another performance and short film are on their way. \n\nWatch music videos by Doja Cat: http://bit.ly/3azELOl\n\nDoja Cat\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DojaCat\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dojacat/\nhttp://www.dojacat.com/\n\nVevo\nhttp://facebook.com/vevo\nhttp://twitter.com/vevo\nhttp://instagram.com/vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: Micah Bickham\nDirector: Priya Minhas\nProducer: Sacha Noelle\nProducer: Maddy Schmidt\nProducer: Ben Fuqua\nProduction Company: Contrast Films\nDirector of Photography: David Okolo\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro & Jordan Ferree\n\n\n#DojaCat  #Streets  #VevoLIFT  #HotPink  \n\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/83XvDH",

He’ll go toe to toe with rap’s biggest names - from Drake (“Yes Indeed”) to Lil Uzi Vert (“Life Goes On”) to even some baby on baby action with DaBaby (“Baby,” of course).

    "description": "Catch up on the first season of Love is Blind, now streaming only on Netflix (www.netflix.com/loveisblind) and then join Jessica, Mark, Lauren, Cameron, Barnett, Amber, Carlton, Diamond, Kelly, Kenny, Giannina and Damian as they share with Nick and Vanessa Lachey what they've learned from their experiences and what it was like to see if play out on screen.\n\nAfter a highly-anticipated season finale, Nick and Vanessa bring the cast of Love is Blind back together for the first time to spill the tea and come clean on the season’s juiciest moments.  All of your burning questions will be answered in this can’t-miss episode.  Which couples are still together?  What was it REALLY like to watch this unfold all over again? Do they have any regrets?  Answers to those questions and more unexpected twists and revelations from the whole experiment explained from the couples who lived it!\n\nMore about the Series: Love is Blind follows the journey of singles who want to be loved for who they are, rather than what they look like. They take a less conventional approach to modern dating where they hope to meet the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with...without ever having seen them. With no distractions from the outside world, the singles talk to a stream of potential love interests and when a meaningful connection is made, they propose and then lay their eyes on their fiancé for the first time. Engaged and back in the real world, as the couples plan their wedding day, they will quickly discover whether they can turn their emotional connection into a physical one before the fast-approaching ceremony. Hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, this addictive series seeks to uncover whether looks or age do matter, or if love really is blind\n\nWatch Love is Blind , only on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80996618\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 167 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.

Now, with hundreds of cases solved and adventures shared, Scooby and the gang face their biggest, most challenging mystery ever: a plot to unleash the ghost dog Cerberus upon the world. As they race to stop this global “dogpocalypse,” the gang discovers that Scooby has a secret legacy and an epic destiny greater than anyone imagined. \nStarring in “SCOOB!” are Will Forte (“Booksmart,” TV’s “The Last Man on Earth”) as Scooby-Doo’s best friend, Shaggy; two-time Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg (“The Fighter,” “The Departed”) as Blue Falcon; Jason Isaacs (the “Harry Potter” films, TV’s “The OA”) as the infamous Dick Dastardly; Gina Rodriguez (“Deepwater Horizon,” TV’s “Jane the Virgin”) as Velma; Zac Efron (“The Greatest Showman,” the “Neighbors” franchise) as Fred; Amanda Seyfried (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Ted 2”) as Daphne; Kiersey Clemons (“Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,” TV’s “Angie Tribeca”) as Falcon Fury pilot Dee Dee Skyes; Ken Jeong (“Crazy Rich Asians,” “The Hangover” trilogy) as the Falcon Force’s Dynomutt; Tracy Morgan (“What Men Want,” TV’s “30 Rock”) as Captain Caveman; Simon Cowell (“American Idol,” “The X Factor”) as himself; and Frank Welker (the “Transformers” franchise) as Scooby-Doo. \n\n“SCOOB!” is directed by Tony Cervone, Annie Award nominee for the feature “Space Jam” and two-time Emmy nominee for his work on “Duck Dodgers.” \n\nThe film is produced by Pam Coats and Allison Abbate.

Donaldson & Derek Elliott and Matt Lieberman, story by Matt Lieberman and Eyal Podell & Jonathon E. Stewart, based on characters created by Hanna-Barbera Productions.

    "title": "Farmers Are Hacking Their Tractors Because of a Repair Ban",
    "description": "As of 2020, no right to repair law has passed in the US.
